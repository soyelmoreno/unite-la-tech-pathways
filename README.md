# Unite-LA's Tech Pathways Academy

As a volunteer for the Software Development phase of the academy, you'll do two
sessions with the cohort:

1. speaker session
2. coding activity

This repo holds resources for the coding activity.

## Setup

Login to Glitch

See if the previous project still exists:

https://glitch.com/edit/#!/shine-nostalgic-blinker

If not, wreate a new project for a static site. Basically just remix (clone)
"Blank Website" and add the code files. Upload the image files into Glitch -->
Assets.

Get the updated URLs for the assets and paste them into the HTML code.

Do your prep work on

- solution.html
- solution.css
- solution.js

Then, when you're ready, save these three files as

- activity.html
- activity.css
- activity.js

Delete everything in activity.css except for the bare miminum starter rules, and a few CSS rules.

## Coding activity

Given a mockup and HTML for a Facebook post, add CSS styles to match the mockup.

Start kids with all the HTML and only one CSS rule. The activity is to write the
CSS.

Note that you have to go slow, so don't make the kids type every rule.

Here's the original Shark Hat Cat Biting post:
